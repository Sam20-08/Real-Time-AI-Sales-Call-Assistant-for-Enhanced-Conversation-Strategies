1. Students who did not take the exam
python
no_exam = [(student_ids[i], names[i]) for i in range(len(scores)) if scores[i] == 0]
print(no_exam)
# Output: [(2, 'Ankit'), (6, 'Ritu')]

 2. Total number of students present in the exam
python
total_present = sum(1 for score in scores if score > 0)
print(total_present)
# Output: 6


 3. Calculate the average score of students
python
male_scores = [scores[i] for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Male' and scores[i] > 0]
female_scores = [scores[i] for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Female' and scores[i] > 0]

avg_score_male = sum(male_scores) / len(male_scores)
avg_score_female = sum(female_scores) / len(female_scores)

print(avg_score_male, avg_score_female)
# Output: 70.0, 72.5

 4. Calculate the median score of the class
python
present_scores = sorted([score for score in scores if score > 0])
n = len(present_scores)
median_score = (present_scores[n//2] if n % 2 != 0 else 
               (present_scores[n//2 - 1] + present_scores[n//2]) / 2)

print(median_score)
# Output: 75.0

 5. Students who attended and not attended the class
python
attended = [[student_ids[i], names[i], scores[i]] for i in range(len(scores)) if scores[i] > 0]
not_attended = [[student_ids[i], names[i], scores[i]] for i in range(len(scores)) if scores[i] == 0]

print(attended, not_attended)
# Output: [[1, 'Amit', 50], ...] [[2, 'Ankit', 0], ...]

 6. Students who failed the exam
python
failed = [[names[i], scores[i]] for i in range(len(scores)) if scores[i] > 0 and scores[i] < 40]
print(failed)
# Output: []

 7. Total male and female students
python
total_male = sum(1 for gender in genders if gender == 'Male')
total_female = sum(1 for gender in genders if gender == 'Female')

print(f"{total_male}, {total_female}")
# Output: 4, 4

 8. Male students who attended the exam
python
male_student_exam = [[names[i], scores[i]] for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Male' and scores[i] > 0]
print(male_student_exam)
# Output: [['Amit', 50], ['Aman', 70], ['Arjun', 90]]

 9. Percentage of male students who passed the exam
python
male_passed = sum(1 for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Male' and scores[i] >= 40)
male_pass_percentage = (male_passed / len(male_scores)) * 100

print(male_pass_percentage)
# Output: 100.0

 10. Percentage of female students who passed the exam
python
female_passed = sum(1 for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Female' and scores[i] >= 40)
female_pass_percentage = (female_passed / len(female_scores)) * 100

print(female_pass_percentage)
# Output: 100.0

 11. Topper performers
python
topper_performers = [(student_ids[i], names[i], scores[i]) for i in range(len(scores)) if scores[i] >= 90]
print(topper_performers)
# Output: [(4, 'Arjun', 90), (8, 'Maya', 95)]


 12. Male and female topper performers
python
male_toppers = sum(1 for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Male' and scores[i] >= 90)
female_toppers = sum(1 for i in range(len(scores)) if genders[i] == 'Female' and scores[i] >= 90)

print(f"{male_toppers}, {female_toppers}")
# Output: 1, 1
