1.	Which of the following statement is the correct one?

	Classification is a supervised machine learning problem

2.	Select which of the following scenarios are classification problems.

	Predict if a Titanic passenger lives or dies due to their age, class, and gender.

3.	At what point in the pipeline process are the parameters adjusted?

	Training

4.	What are some common evaluation metrics used for classification tasks?

	Accuracy

5.	Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

	True

6.	In a learning problem with 2D features, what is the relationship between decision tree and 1-nearest neighbor decision boundaries?

	In both cases, the decision boundary is piecewise linear.

7.	What does 'naive' mean in Naive Bayes?

	The model assumes that the input features are statistically independent of one another.

8.	How does ensemble learning improve model performance?

	The models in an ensemble are trained independently, and their predictions are combined in some way to produce the final output.

9.	Given a confusion matrix for a binary classification problem, how would you compute the precision score?

	Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

10.	Compute the precision score to one decimal place:

	Precision = 15 / (15 + 10) = 0.6

11.	Compute the recall score to one decimal place:

	Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) = 20 / (20 + 5) = 0.8

12.	As a reviewer for an international conference, would you accept or reject this paper?

	Reject

13.	For k cross-validation, larger k value implies more bias:

	False

14.	Scenario fit based on models:

	Model 3 fits better a High Bias scenario
	Model 2 fits better a High Variance scenario
