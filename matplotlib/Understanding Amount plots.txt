1. Draw four horizontal bars with different lengths, labels, and colors using Matplotlib.

Use the following dataset and colors list:

bar_lengths = [3, 4, 5, 6]  # Adjust the lengths as needed
bar_labels = ['Bar 1', 'Bar 2', 'Bar 3', 'Bar 4']
bar_colors = ['skyblue', 'salmon', 'lightgreen', 'lightcoral']

# Create a horizontal bar plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Create the horizontal bars
ax.barh( bar_labels ,bar_lengths,color= bar_colors)

# Add labels and title
ax.set_xlabel("Length")
ax.set_ylabel("Bars")
ax.set_title("Horizontal Bar Plot")
