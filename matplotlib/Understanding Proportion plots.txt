1. What does a pie chart typically represent?
a. Proportions of different categories within a whole.
b. Time series data.
c. Distribution of a categorical dataset.
d. Correlation between two variables.

Correct! a
2. In a bar plot, what does the height of each bar usually represent?
a. The variance of the category.
b. The frequency or value of the category.
c. The proportion of the category compared to the whole.
d. The mean value of the category.

Correct! b
3. You are given a pie chart showing market share of five companies and a bar graph depicting their annual profits. How would you use these charts in conjunction to draw insights about the companies' performance?
a. The pie chart can be used to understand the relative market dominance of each company,
while the bar graph can provide insights into their absolute profit figures. 
Comparing these charts could reveal, for instance, whether a company with a large market share 
is also proportionately profitable.

b. By examining the pie chart, we can determine the annual profits of each company based on their market share,
as the market share directly indicates profitability. Similarly, from the bar graph of annual profits, 
we can precisely calculate the market share percentages of each company. Thus, 
these charts allow us to interchangeably use market share to determine profits and vice versa.

Correct! a

Activity: Create a bar plot for given dataÂ¶

# Data
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
values = [23, 45, 12, 35]
# Create the figure and axis objects
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange']
# Creating the bar graph
ax.bar(categories,values,color = colors)
# Your code here
ax.set_xlabel('Categories')
ax.set_ylabel('Values')
ax.set_title('Bar Plot for Categories')

# Display the chart
plt.show()
