Activity 1. Create an Ugly Plot
# Create an ugly plot here
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
ax.plot(x,y, color = 'blue', marker='o',markersize = 12)
ax.set_title("Ugly Plot")

fig.show()

Activity 2. Create a Bad Plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))

# Write your code here to plot a bad 
ax.plot(x, y,color = 'black')
ax.set_title("Bad Plot")
fig.show()

Activity 3. Create a Wrong Plot

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))

ax.plot(x, y, color='red')
ax.set_title("Wrong Plot")
plt.show()

4. Which of the following characteristics typically makes a data plot 'ugly'?
a. Use of accurate and relevant data
b. Simplified representation of complex data
c. Clear and distinct labeling of axes
d. Clashing color schemes and cluttered presentation

Correct! d

5. What is a key factor in identifying a 'wrong' plot in data visualization?
a. The plot uses a variety of colors.
b. The plot lacks aesthetic appeal.
c,. Data is represented in a mathematically inaccurate or misleading way.
d. The data is complex and difficult to understand.

Correct! c

6. Consider two plots shown to you, Plot A and Plot B, both attempting to represent the same dataset. Which one of these plots would you classify as 'wrong' based on our discussions, and why?

a. Plot A, because it uses a very bright and clashing color scheme.
b. Plot B, because it uses a simple line chart with altered y values instead of accurately representing the sine wave.
c. Plot B, because it represents the data with a misleading scale on the axes, altering the true nature of the sine wave.
d. Plot A, because it contains too many data points, making it look cluttered.

Correct! c
