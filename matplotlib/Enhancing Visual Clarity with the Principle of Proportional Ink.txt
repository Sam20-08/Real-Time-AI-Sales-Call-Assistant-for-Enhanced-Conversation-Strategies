# Sample data
months = range(1, 13)  # Representing 12 months
sales = [45, 50, 55, 40, 65, 60, 75, 70, 85, 80, 95, 100]

# Creating a line graph with misleading y-axis scale
plt.plot(months, [x * 100 for x in sales], marker='o', color='red')  # Exaggerated y-axis scale

# Adding misleading titles and labels
plt.title('Skyrocketing Monthly Sales Trend')  # Misleading title
plt.xlabel('Time (in centuries)')  # Misleading x-axis label
plt.ylabel('Sales (in billions)')  # Misleading y-axis label

# Display the misleading plot
plt.show()
