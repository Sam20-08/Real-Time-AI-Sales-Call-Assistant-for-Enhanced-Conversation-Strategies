1. Plot a histogram using the writing scores data.
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax1.hist(students_df['writing score'], bins = 30, alpha = 0.6, color = 'green', density = 'true') # Write your code here.

ax1.set_xlabel('Score')
ax1.set_ylabel('Frequency')
ax1.set_title('Writing Score')

2. Activity 2: Creating a Horizontal Box Plot with Matplotlib
fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax2.boxplot(students_df['reading score'], vert=False)
ax2.set_ylabel('Reading Scores')
ax2.set_title('Distribution of Reading Scores')

Activity 3: Compare the Distribution of Reading and Writing Scores 
reading_scores = students_df['reading score']
writing_scores = students_df['writing score']
scores_data = [reading_scores, writing_scores]

fig3, ax3 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax3.boxplot(scores_data, labels=['Reading Score', 'Writing Score'])
ax3.set_ylabel('Score')
ax3.set_title('Comparison of Reading and Writing Scores')

Activity 4: Comparing Reading Scores by Test Preparation
# Separate Reading Scores by Test Preparation Course
completed_prep = students_df[students_df['test preparation course'] == 'completed']['reading score']
no_prep = students_df[students_df['test preparation course'] == 'none']['reading score']
# Store the data to plot
reading_scores = [completed_prep, no_prep]
# Create the boxplot
fig4, ax4 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax4.boxplot(reading_scores, labels=['Completed Prep', 'No Prep'])
# Add labels and title
ax4.set_ylabel('Reading Score')
ax4.set_title('Reading Scores by Test Preparation Course')
# Show the plot
plt.show()

Activity 5: Comparing Math, Reading, and Writing Scores in a Single Graph
math_scores = students_df['math score']
reading_scores = students_df['reading score']
writing_scores = students_df['writing score']

scores_data = [math_scores, reading_scores, writing_scores]

fig5, ax5 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax5.boxplot(scores_data, labels=['Math Score', 'Reading Score', 'Writing Score'])
ax5.set_ylabel('Score')
ax5.set_title('Comparison of Math, Reading, and Writing Scores')


Activity 6: Analyzing Reading Score Variation by Race/Ethnicity

groups = students_df['race/ethnicity'].unique()  # Unique categories of race/ethnicity
data_to_plot = [students_df[students_df['race/ethnicity'] == group]['reading score'] for group in groups]


fig6, ax6 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax6.boxplot(data_to_plot, labels=groups)
ax6.set_ylabel('Reading Score')
ax6.set_title('Reading Scores by Race/Ethnicity')
